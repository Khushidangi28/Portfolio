            <h2>About Me</h2>
                Hello, I'm Khushi Dangi, a passionate Computer Science student with a strong foundation in Core Java and a deep interest in full-stack development and data structures. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a genuine enthusiasm for solving real-world problems through technology and creating impactful solutions.

Currently, I'm focused on building my expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, with a particular emphasis on mastering React, Java, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m actively working to enhance my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), which I believe are fundamental for developing efficient software solutions. By honing my technical abilities, I aim to establish a well-rounded profile that enables me to take on challenges in software development and tech innovation.

I thrive in environments where collaboration is key, and I'm always looking to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for exploring new ideas and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the tech industry. I am highly motivated to learn and adapt to emerging technologies, believing that continuous growth is essential to succeed in this dynamic field.

Aside from my academic work, I am deeply committed to making meaningful contributions in the tech community. I am always excited by the opportunity to work on innovative projects that drive change and deliver real value.
